# Client Principles

All clients (web, iOS, Android) follow the same rules:

1. Call only the backend API.
2. Never hard-code framework, level, or AI behavior.
3. Render the structured study units returned by the backend.
4. Support the four language modes by displaying the fields the backend already prepared (hebrew, transliteration, english, etc.).
